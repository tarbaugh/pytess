# Welcome to pyextractsum!

Start by cloning the git repository and making sure you have python 3.9.0 installed

I recommend using a virtual enviroment with venv
(Mac/Linux)
```bash
python3 -m venv env
```
(Windows)
```bash
py -m venv env
```

Make sure the Images folder is populated with images labeled in integer order.
Then, install the required python packages with
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Next, run
```python
python3 cv.py
```
